All TypeScript files should follow these instructions.

- Use `biome` for formatting and linting. (Run `pnpm run lint` to check, `pnpm run lint:fix` to fix)
- Use `pnpm` as the package manager.
- Use `pnpm` workspaces to manage monorepo structure.
- Use `tsconfig.json` to manage TypeScript configurations.
